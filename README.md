# Anagram

This script finds anagram words in a document and write them to a result file

An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example Doctor Who can be rearranged into Torchwood. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an "anagrammatist".[1] The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram.
